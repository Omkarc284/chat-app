# Project Problem Statement
Develop a real-time chat application using Node.js that includes features like: 

 

1. user authentication
2. message encryption

3. and the ability to send images. 

 
Ensure the application is scalable and can handle a large number of concurrent users. 

Additionally, provide documentation on the architecture and explain how you addressed potential security concerns.

## Deadline - 48 hours

## Note :
The project is not fully complete however the backend code has the following functionality:
1. Implementation of Socket.io in NodeJs.
2. Authentication Routes implemented using jwt and bcrypt
3. Database Models in MongoDB using mongoose.
4. ReactJs implementation.

` The project has .env files included although I'm aware of it not being a good practice to include in the repo, but this is for project purposes and the ENV variables will be redundant after the purpose of this repo is fulfilled.`


## Challenges:
1. This project is too big for a `48 hour` duration.
2. Stuck in dependencies in frontend.
3. Project is incomplete.
